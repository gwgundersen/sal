        Sal - a document knowledge base

Sal indexes a directory of documents (PDF, Markdown, plain text, HTML,
Org) using Claude to extract structured metadata — title, topics, summary,
sections, key terms, prerequisites, and key results — into JSON cards.
It stores full text in an FTS5 search index for fast retrieval.

Sal can be used three ways: as a CLI, as a web UI, or as an MCP server
that gives Claude access to your documents.


REQUIREMENTS

  - Python 3.11+
  - An Anthropic API key (export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...)


INSTALLING

  pip install -e .

Or with uv:

  uv pip install -e .


USAGE

Index the current directory:

  sal init

This reads every supported file, sends it to Claude for metadata
extraction, and writes a JSON card per document under .sal/index/.
It also populates an FTS5 database at .sal/search.db.

List indexed documents:

  sal ls

Start the web UI:

  sal serve              # http://localhost:8888
  sal serve --port 3000

The web UI shows all indexed documents, their metadata cards, and
provides full-text search.

Run as an MCP server (for use with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.):

  sal --resources /path/to/docs

This exposes three MCP tools: List, Read, and Search.
